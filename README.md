# Google-Reviews-Classification-Natural-Language-Processing
In this NLP project you will be attempting to classify Google Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a business by a user. The stars column is the number of stars assigned by the reviewer to the business. The cool column is the number of "cool" mentions this review received and the useful and funny columns follow this structure. This is gathered review data and does not have the actual business information
